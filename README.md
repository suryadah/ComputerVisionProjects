Edge Detection and Image Enhancement Using Laplacian, SOBEL and wiener

A Medical Image Processing Article was analyzed, and its methods were implemented in an attempt to produce similar results. The article presented edge detection and image enhancement techniques for processing medical images using Laplacian, Sobel operator, pixel addition and multiplication operator and power law transformation. These techniques were presented as a solution to improve the low intensity and contrast on medical images obtained from X-ray, CT etc. and help in diagnosis. Except for the Power Law transformation all the other techniques were implemented in this Project in an addition to Histogram Equalization
